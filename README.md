<br /> 
This repository contains code to program the MSP432P401R Microcontroller using the Arduino IDE to perform line following and maze solving.
<br /> 

There is code for both automatic and manual, as well as some different options within the line following script to change the robots preferred behavior.
<br /> 

The sensors used include 2 HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors, 6x snap action bump switches, and 8x IR phototransistors. The IR sensors are used for line following, ultrasonic sensors for maze solving, and the bump switches for both.
<br /> 

It is required to install the Energia MSP432 EMT RED under boards manager in the Arduino IDE. A guide to walkthrough using the board and getting it set up can be found at: https://www.energia.nu/.
